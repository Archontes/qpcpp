@subsection gs_help_seq Reading QP&trade; Help Sequentially
You can move from topic to topic by means of the <span class="strong underline">Next:</span> link at the bottom of each page.

@subsection gs_help_random Quickly Locating a Topic of Interest
You can use the following elements:

- the @ref gs_tree_view "Tree View" pane on the left-hand side of the browser;

- the **Table of Contents** box in the top-right corner of the page;

- the **Search** box in the upper-right corner of the browser window


<div class="separate"></div>
@subsection gs_tree_view Using the Tree View
The *Tree View* pane on the left-hand side of the browser displays the hierarchical Table of Contents, which can be either **linked-to** or **unlinked-from** the *Current Topic* displayed on the right-hand side. You can toggle between the two modes by pressing the **Link/Unlink Current Topic** icon at the top of the *Tree View* pane.

<img src="img/tree-view_linked.png" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;">
When the *Tree View* is **linked** to the Current Topic, the *Tree View* will always follow the currently viewed topic, by expanding and highlighting the pertinent section of the hierarchical Table of Contents.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>
<img src="img/tree-view_unlinked.png" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;">
When the *Tree View* is **unlinked** from the Current Topic, the *Tree View* will show only the explicitly selected section of the hierarchical Table of Contents and will **not** follow the topics activated by internal documentation links.
