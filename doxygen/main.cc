@section about About QP/C++
<p><a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/products/"><strong>QP/C++&trade; (Quantum Platform in C++)</strong></a> is a lightweight, open source <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/doc/concepts.html#Framework">active object (actor) framework</a> for building responsive and modular real-time embedded applications as systems of cooperating, event-driven <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/doc/concepts.html#Active">active objects</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actors</a>). The QP/C++&trade; framework is a member of a larger family consisting of QP/C++, <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/qpcpp" target="_blank" class="extern">QP/C</a>, and <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/qpcn" target="_blank" class="extern">QP-nano</a> frameworks, which are all strictly quality controlled, thoroughly documented, and <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/licensing" target="_blank" class="extern">commercially licensable</a>.
</p>

All QP&trade; frameworks can run on @ref exa_native "bare-metal single-chip microcontrollers", completely replacing a traditional Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The frameworks contain a selection of built-in real-time kernels, such as the cooperative @ref comp_qv "QV kernel", the preemptive non-blocking @ref comp_qk "QK kernel", and the preemptive, blocking @ref comp_qxk "QXK kernel", <span class="highlight">which provides all the features you might expect from a traditional <strong>RTOS kernel</strong></span>. @ref ports_native "Native QP ports" and ready-to-use @ref exa_native "examples" are provided for major @ref exa_ref_mcu "CPU families".

QP/C++ can also work with many traditional @ref exa_rtos "RTOSes" and @ref exa_rtos "desktop OSes" (such as Windows and Linux).

The behavior of active objects is specified in QP by means of
<a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/doc/concepts.html#HSM">hierarchical state machines (UML statecharts)</a>. The frameworks support manual coding of UML state machines in C or C++ as well as fully automatic code generation by means of the free graphical <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/qm">QM&trade; modeling tool</a>.

The QP frameworks are used in <a href="http://www.state-machine.com/about/customers.html" target="_blank" class="extern">millions of products worldwide</a> in aerospace, medical devices, consumer electronics, wired and wireless telecommunications, industrial automation, transportation, robotics, and many more. The QP frameworks and the <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/qm">QM modeling tool</a> receive over <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qpc/files/stats/timeline?dates=2015-01-01+to+2015-12-31">40,000 downloads a year</a>. The book, <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/psicc2" >Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, 2nd Edition</a> provides a detailed design study of the QP frameworks and explains all the related concepts.

@section licensing Licensing QP/C++

QP/C++ is licensed under the increasingly popular <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/licensing">dual licensing model</a>, in which both the open source software distribution mechanism and traditional closed source software distribution models are combined.

@note If your company has a policy forbidding open source in your product, all QP frameworks can be licensed commercially, in which case you don't use any open source license and you do not violate your policy.

Open Source Projects:
---------------------

Please note that GPL requires that all modifications to the original code as well as your application code (Derivative Works as defined in the Copyright Law) must also be released under the terms of the GPL open source license.

Closed Source Projects:
-----------------------
If you are developing and distributing traditional closed source applications, you can purchase one of <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="http://www.state-machine.com/licensing/index.html#Commercial">Quantum Leaps commercial licenses</a>, which are specifically designed for users interested in retaining the proprietary status of their code. All Quantum Leaps commercial licenses expressly supersede the GPL open source license. This means that when you license Quantum Leaps software under a commercial license, you specifically do not use the software under the open source license and therefore you are not subject to any of its terms.
